There are all of my class code ,picture and videos included in this git repository with their proper arrangement and serial.
To find the code and output hands on test goto the each file .
Then there will be code file as .ino extension , text file as .text extensions,  picture as .jpg and video as .mp4
Just simply goto the each file to run it properly and get the output.
